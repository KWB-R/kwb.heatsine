Title: R Package for Calculating Hydraulic Travel Times Based on
    Sinus Temperature Fitting
Version: 0.0.0.9000

Description: Requires daily temperature times series in a
    surface water body and one groundwater observation well (in case of an
    production well this data needs to be cleaned in order to reduce
    temperature fluctuations due to the operation scheme!).
